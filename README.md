# 9.660ProjectFinal

The code for our Bayesian model is in 9.66_finalproject.ipynb. Running this code requires the following files: cmu_in_childes_small.csv, training_sentences.csv, and testing_sentences.csv. Link to Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UNDd1OB7SthHPZJiDYRD5lN787R4rwGq?usp=sharing

We adapted code for cleaning and pre-processing the CHILDES data (1 - Create Vocabulary and Pronunciations.ipynb and 2 - Providence - Retrieve Data.ipynb) from https://github.com/smeylan/child-directed-listening.
